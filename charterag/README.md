# Charterag Project

Charterag is a responsive web application built using [Next.js](https://nextjs.org). It features smooth animations powered by the [AOS (Animate on Scroll)](https://michalsnik.github.io/aos/) library and adheres to modern web accessibility standards (WCAG). The styling of the application is crafted using [Sass](https://sass-lang.com), enabling efficient and maintainable CSS.

## Features

- **Responsive Design**: Optimized for various screen sizes, ensuring a seamless user experience across devices.
- **Smooth Animations**: Powered by the AOS library for engaging and dynamic animations.
- **Accessibility Compliance**: Verified against the [WCAG](https://www.w3.org/WAI/standards-guidelines/wcag/) standards for accessibility.
- **Efficient Styling**: Built using Sass for modular, reusable, and maintainable styles.
